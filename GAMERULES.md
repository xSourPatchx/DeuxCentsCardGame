## Gameplay

### Betting Phase
1. Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, each player in clockwise order gets one opportunity to either:
   - **Pass**, OR
   - **Bet** a value between 50 and 100 (in intervals of 5) that has not been bet already.
2. The betting round ends immediately if any one of the following occurs:
   - A player bets 100.
   - Three players have passed.
3. The last player to make a valid bet is the "betting player" and their bet is the team's target score.
4. **Special Cases:**
   - If the first three players pass, the fourth player is forced to bet **50**.
   - If a player bets 100, all subsequent players must pass.
5. **The 100-Point Rule:** A team with a total score of 100 points or more can only add points to its score in a round if at least one of its team members made a bet during the betting phase (it does not have to be the winning bet). If neither member placed a bet, that teams points do not count, regardless of how many points their cards were worth.

### Trump Selection and Play
1. After the betting phase concludes, the player who won the bet immediately chooses the trump suit for the round.
2. The betting player leads the first trick.
3. Play proceeds clockwise.

### Trick Rules
1. The suit led must be followed if possible
2. If a player cannot follow suit, they may play any card
3. A trick is won by:
   - The highest card of the suit led, OR
   - The highest trump card if any were played (when players couldn't follow the led suit)
4. The winner of each trick collects all points from that trick for their team
5. The winner of each trick leads the next trick

### Scoring
1. After all 10 tricks are played, teams count the point values of the cards they collected.
2. For the betting team:
   - If they collected at least the number of points they bet, they add the total points from their cards to their score.
   - If they collected fewer points than they bet, they subtract the amount they bid from their score. The points from their cards do not count.
3. For the non-betting team: They always add the total points from their cards to their score.
4. The first team to reach or exceed 200 points wins the game.

## Example 1: Team 1 Makes Their Bet
- After all cards are played, Team 1 collects **80** points.
- Team 2 collects **20** points.
**Scoring Result:**
- Team 1 made their bet (80 ≥ 75), so they **score 80 points**.
- Team 2 (non-betting) **scores 20 points**.

## Example 2: Team 1 Fails Their Bet
- After all cards are played, Team 1 collects **70** points.
- Team 2 collects **30** points.
**Scoring Result:**
- Team 1 failed their bet (70 < 75), so they **lose 75 points**.
- Team 2 (non-betting) **scores 30 points**.

## Example 3: High-Scoring Team Fails to Bet & Betting Team Fails Their Bid
- Team 1 currently has 110 points.
- Team 2 currently has 80 points.
- During the betting phase, no one from Team 1 places a bet (both players pass). A player from Team 2 wins the bet with 60.
- After all cards are played:
  - Team 1 collects 65 points.
  - Team 2 collects 35 points.
**Scoring Result:**
- Team 1 has over 100 points and did not place a bet, so their 65 points do not count. They score 0.
- Team 2 made their bet of 60 (they collected 35, which is less than 60), so they fail. They lose 60 points, scoring -60.
New Scores: Team 1: 110 | Team 2: 20 (80 - 60)

*(This example highlights the critical rule that a team with 100+ points must have a bet to score, and shows a betting team failing their bid.)*

## Example 4: Winning the Game with a Successful Bet
- Team 1 currently has 190 points.
- Team 2 currently has 180 points.
- A player from Team 1 wins the bet with 85 and chooses Spades as trump.
- After all cards are played:
  - Team 1 collects 90 points.
  - Team 2 collects 10 points.
**Scoring Result:**
- Team 1 made their bet (90 ≥ 85), so they score the 90 points they collected. Their new total is 190 + 90 = 280 points. They have exceeded 200 and win the game.
- Team 2 scores their 10 points, but the game is already over.

## Example 5: Further clarity on the 100+ point rule
- Team 1 currently has 105 points.
- Team 2 currently has 90 points.
- During the betting phase, only Player 1 (from Team 1) places a bet of 55. No one from Team 2 bets.
- After all cards are played:
  - Team 1 collects 60 points.
  - Team 2 collects 40 points.
**Scoring Result**:
- Team 1 has over 100 points, but a team member did place a bet, so they are eligible to score. They made their bet (60 ≥ 55), so they score their 60 points. New total: 165.
- Team 2 did not bet, so they always score their points. They score 40 points. New total: 130.
