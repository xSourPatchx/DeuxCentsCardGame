Absolutely. I've reviewed your rules, and they are very well-structured. However, a few areas could benefit from minor clarifications to eliminate any potential ambiguity during gameplay.

Here is a scan of the rules for uncertainty and ambiguity, followed by suggested tweaks.

---

### **Ambiguity & Clarity Scan**

**1. The "Must Bet" Rule for High-Scoring Teams**
> **Original Rule:** *"Teams with 100+ points can only score if at least one team member placed a bet during the betting round."*

*   **Ambiguity:** This is a crucial and punishing rule, but the phrasing "placed a bet" could be misinterpreted. Does it mean *any* bet, or only the *winning* bet? The intent is to force the leading team to compete for the right to score, but the wording is slightly open.
*   **Suggestion:** Make it explicitly clear that *any* bet, even a lost one, qualifies the team.

**2. The Betting End Trigger**
> **Original Rule:** *"Betting continues until: Three of the four players have passed OR A player has bet 100"*

*   **Ambiguity:** The interaction between these two conditions isn't specified. What happens if a player bets 100 *after* two players have passed? The rule is correct, but it could be phrased more sequentially for clarity.
*   **Suggestion:** Frame it as a step-by-step process for each player's turn.

**3. Scoring for the Betting Team**
> **Original Rule:** *"If they fail to make their bet, they lose the amount they bid in points and score nothing"*

*   **Ambiguity:** The phrase "score nothing" might be confused with "get zero points for the cards they collected." It's clear to you, but a new player might wonder, "Do we still *add* our card points and *then* subtract the bid?" The answer is no, but the rule could be more mathematically precise.
*   **Suggestion:** State the net score change explicitly.

**4. Trump Selection Clarification**
> **Original Rule:** *"The player who won the bet chooses the trump suit"*

*   **Minor Ambiguity:** It's not explicitly stated *when* they choose the trump suit. It's logically *after* betting and *before* the first trick, but stating it clearly prevents questions.
*   **Suggestion:** Add a single sentence to define the timing.

### **Revised Rules Sections (Incorporate These Changes)**

Here are the specific sections of your rules, rewritten for 100% clarity.

#### **In the "Betting Phase" Section:**
*(Replace the entire "Betting continues until..." point and the "Important" note with this more detailed version.)*

**Revised Betting Phase:**
1.  Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, each player in clockwise order gets one opportunity to either:
    *   **Pass**, OR
    *   **Bet** a value between 50 and 100 (in intervals of 5) that has not been bet already.
2.  The betting round ends immediately if **any one** of the following occurs:
    *   A player bets **100**.
    *   **Three players** have passed.
3.  The last player to make a valid bet is the "betting player" and their bet is the team's target score.
4.  **Special Cases:**
    *   If the first three players pass, the fourth player is forced to bet **50**.
    *   If a player bets 100, all subsequent players must pass.
5.  **The 100-Point Rule:** A team with a total score of **100 points or more** can only add points to its score in a round if **at least one of its team members made a bet during the betting phase** (it does not have to be the winning bet). If neither member bet, the team scores 0 for the round, regardless of how many points their cards were worth.

#### **In the "Trump Selection and Play" Section:**
*(Add one sentence for clarity.)*

**Revised Trump Selection and Play:**
1.  After the betting phase concludes, the player who won the bet **immediately chooses** the trump suit for the round.
2.  The betting player leads the first trick.
3.  Play proceeds clockwise.

#### **In the "Scoring" Section:**
*(Clarify the points for a failed bet.)*

**Revised Scoring:**
1.  After all 10 tricks are played, teams count the point values of the cards they collected.
2.  **For the betting team:**
    *   If they collected **at least** the number of points they bet, they add the total points from their cards to their score.
    *   If they collected **fewer** points than they bet, they **subtract the amount they bid** from their score. The points from their cards do not count.
3.  **For the non-betting team:** They always add the total points from their cards to their score.
4.  The first team to reach or exceed **200 points** wins the game.

By implementing these small tweaks, you'll preemptively answer the most likely questions and ensure the game runs smoothly from the first deal. Great job on a solid set of rules
