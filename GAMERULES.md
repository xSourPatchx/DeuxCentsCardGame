## Gameplay

### Betting Phase
1. Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, each player can:
   - Pass OR
   - Bet a value between 50 and 100 (in intervals of 5)
2. Players cannot bet the same value that has already been bet
3. Betting continues until:
   - Three of the four players have passed OR
   - A player has bet 100
4. Special cases:
   - If the first three players pass, the 4th player must bet 50
   - After a player bets 100, all remaining players must pass
5. **Important**: Teams with 100+ points can only score if at least one team member placed a bet during the betting round.

### Trump Selection and Play
1. The player who won the bet chooses the trump suit
2. The betting player leads the first trick
3. Play proceeds clockwise

### Trick Rules
1. The suit led must be followed if possible
2. If a player cannot follow suit, they may play any card
3. A trick is won by:
   - The highest card of the suit led, OR
   - The highest trump card if any were played (when players couldn't follow the led suit)
4. The winner of each trick collects all points from that trick for their team
5. The winner of each trick leads the next trick

### Scoring
1. After all 10 tricks are played, teams count their points
2. For the betting team:
   - If they make their bet (collect at least the number of points they bet), they score the points they collected
   - If they fail to make their bet, they lose the amount they bid in points and score nothing
3. The non-betting team always scores the points they collected
4. First team to reach 200 points wins the game

## Example
- Team 1 (Players 1 & 3) bets 75 points
- After all cards are played:
  - If Team 1 collects 80 points, they score 80 points
  - If Team 1 collects 70 points, they lose 75 points (the amount they bid)
  - Team 2 always scores the points they collected (in this example, either 20 or 30 points)
