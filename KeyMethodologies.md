Here are the key methodologies for your multiplayer card game project:

• **MVC/MVP** - Separate game logic from display/input for easier Unity porting
• **State Pattern/FSM** - Manage game flow states (waiting, dealing, player turns, etc.)
• **Command Pattern** - Encapsulate player actions for undo/redo and network sync
• **Event-Driven Architecture** - Handle multiplayer notifications and game events
• **Dependency Injection** - Swap between AI, human, and network players easily
• **Core Logic Separation** - Keep game rules in plain C# classes, not Unity-dependent code

Each of these will help with both your current console version and the Unity transition.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
